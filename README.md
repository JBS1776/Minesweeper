# Minesweeper

# Update September 2020
This is a simple minesweeper game I implemented this past summer.  My goal was to make the gameplay feel similar to the Windows 7 version of Minesweeper as this is my favorite version of Minesweeper.  Since I have Chess and Minesweeper in the works, it occurred to me to recreate as many Windows 7 version games as I can.  I'm working on a Solitaire game as well that I will upload as soon as it becomes operational.  I'm overall impressed with how this app turned out.  A game starts by automatically filling in all empty spaces instead of the player needing to hit the middle of the board to start.  I acknowledge this is not conventional but I personally don't believe it ruins the minesweeper experience.  The settings support resizing the board and how many mines it has and will throw errors when you include out of range dimensions or mine count.  The game also has a timer but the elapsed time does not display until the game ends.  I plan on improving the puzzle generation method as the current implementation is completely random and very prone to guessing (though I think the Windows 7 version was prone to guessing also).  I also am considering including sound effects especially when Electrode uses Explosion (aka the mines blow up)!
